The network of atomic clocks aboard the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites form a detector that may be used for dark matter searches. Some ultralight dark matter models with self-interaction, such as topological defects or Q-balls, allow for the possibility of dark matter constituents causing a transient shift in fundamental constants. These shifts would affect the readings of atomic clocks. As a macroscopic dark matter object sweeps through the GPS network, it would cause a pattern of de-synchronization between  pairs of atomic clocks. Our ability to model the effect of a clumpy dark matter candidate's sweep across the GPS network of atomic clocks provides the opportunity to utilize the matched-filter technique in the search of dark matter interaction events. In this paper, we will discuss the application of the matched-filter methodology in the search ofr dark matter signatures in nearly two decades of archival GPS atomic clock data.
