I held the learning assistant position for this class for four semesters where I provided in-class assistance, review lectures, office hours for tutoring, and created a series of recitation videos to accompany lectures (see above).
<br>
<h3>MATH 295/301/302 - Introduction to Proofs</h3>
Undergraduate course, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Fall 2017 - Fall 2018
<br>
<br>
Foundations of mathematical proof writing for advanced courses in the Math/Stat majors. Proof methods will be applied to topics in logic; mathematical induction; elementary set theory; functions; properties of integers and real numbers.

<br>
I held the position as teaching assistant for the NevadaFit summer program for incoming freshman where my duties include providing review lectures and grading.
<br>
<h3>PHYS 151 - General Physics I</h3>
Undergraduate course, Department of Physics, Spring 2017
