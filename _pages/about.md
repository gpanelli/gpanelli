<p align="justify">
I am an undergraduate physics and mathematics student at the University of Nevada, Reno, currently working with Dr. Andrei Derevianko on a dark matter detection experiment using the atomic clock data from GPS satellites (see the <a href="http://www.dereviankogroup.com/">GPS.DM Collaboration</a>). I also work with Dr. Joshua Williams on dissociative electron attachment and photodissociation molecular dynamics experiments. Previously, I have performed exoplanet detection experiments with the <a href="http://www.greatbasinobservatory.org/">Great Basin Observatory</a>. Lastly, I am currently one of the Senior Co-Editors for the Nevada State Undergraduate Research Journal (<a href="http://www.nsurj.com/">NSURJ</a>).

<br/><img src='/images/gpsdm.jpg' width='140' height='140' align='left' hspace="15"> The GPS.DM Collaboration is searching for dark matter using GPS atomic clock data. The techniques developed by this group have wide applicability to other networks of precision measurement devises searching for exotic physics.
