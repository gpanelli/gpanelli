I am an undergraduate physics and mathematics student at the University of Nevada, Reno, 
currently working with Dr. Andrei Derevianko on a dark matter detection experiment 
using the atomic clock data from GPS stellites (see the [GPS.DM Collaboration](http://www.dereviankogroup.com/)). 
I have also started projects on wave function ontology and related problems in the metaphysics 
of quantum mechanics. Previously, I have performed exoplanet detection experiments with 
the [Great Basin Observatory](http://www.greatbasinobservatory.org/).
