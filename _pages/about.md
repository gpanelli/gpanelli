<p align="justify">
I am a graduate physics student at Stanford University working under Mark Kasevich. We are investigating spin squeezing with Strontium atoms with applications to atom interferometry and metrology at large. I received my undergraduate degrees in physics and pure mathematics from the University of Nevada, Reno working under Andrei Derevianko and Joshua Williams.
