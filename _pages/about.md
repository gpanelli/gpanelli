I am a graduate physics student at Stanford University, currently undergoing research group rotations. I received my undergraduate degrees in physics and pure mathematics from the University of Nevada, Reno. My research at the University of Nevada included a dark matter detection experiment using the atomic clock data from GPS satellites (see the <a href="http://www.dereviankogroup.com/">GPS.DM Collaboration</a>) with Dr. Andrei Derevianko as well as dissociative electron attachment and photodissociation molecular dynamics experiments with Dr. Joshua Williams.

The techniques developed by this group have wide applicability to other networks of precision measurement devises searching for exotic physics. <a href="https://gpanelli.github.io/posts/2019/07/GPSDM/">Read More</a>
