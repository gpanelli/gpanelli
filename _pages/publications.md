My previous research has been in atomic physics. This includes analysis of dissociative electron attachment experiments (performed by Dr. Dan Slaughter at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Dr. Joshua Williams at the University of Nevada, Reno) and direct dark matter detection experiments with networks of precision measurement devices - particularly atomic clocks (with Dr. Andrei Derevianko).

<b>Investigating resonant low-energy electron attachment to formamide: dynamics of model peptide bond dissociation and other fragmentation channels</b>
<br>
<br/><img src='/images/nh2-6p8.png' width='250' height='150' align='right' hspace='15'> We report experimental results on three-dimensional momentum imaging measurements of anions generated via dissociative electron attachment to gaseous formamide. From the momentum images, we analyze the angular and kinetic energy distributions for NH2-, O−, and H− fragments and discuss the possible electron attachment and dissociation mechanisms for multiple resonances... <a href="https://gpanelli.github.io/publication/2020-06-27-DEA-Formamide">Read More</a>

<b>Applying the matched-filter technique to the search for dark matter with networks of quantum sensors</b>
<br>
<br/><img src='/images/exclusions-new-1.jpg' width='250' height='150' align='right' hspace='15'> There are several networks of precision sensors in existence, including networks of atomic clocks, magnetometers, and gravitational wave detectors. These networks can be re-purposed for searches of exotic physics, such as direct dark matter searches. Here we explore a detection strategy for macroscopic dark matter objects with... <a href="https://gpanelli.github.io/publication/2019-07-09-Matched-Filter-Technique">Read More</a>

<b>Exoplanet Detection Via Transit Photometry Using the Great Basin Observatory</b>
<br>
<br/><img src='/images/comparison-1.png' width='250' height='314' align='right' hspace='15'> Exoplanet detection via transit photometry has blossomed into one of the most fruitful fields in all of physics in the last decade with NASA missions like Kepler. We conducted transit photometry on the star Kepler-17, known host to exoplanet Kepler-17b, on June 26, 2018 using the Great Basin Observatory in an effort to perform the one of the first exoplanet detections in the telescope’s 2-year history. We also gauge the lower limits of host star brightness for which the 0.7-meter telescope retains sensitivity and establish a transit depth threshold for detection confidence. We present evidence... <a href="https://gpanelli.github.io/publication/2019-06-11-Exoplanet-Detection">Read More</a>
